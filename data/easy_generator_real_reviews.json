I knew we were planning on getting different areas of the organisation to create e-learnings in order to facilitate knowledge sharing but other platforms etc were going to be difficult to train people, especially when not in the L&D space day to day. Not only is our customer success manager amazing, so are the various trainers who have helped us seamlessly implement EasyGenerator across the organisation. This platform is simple enough for our subject matter experts to use and the course builder functionalities mean they can use materials in other formats to give them a starting point. I cannot recommend EasyGenerator enough, especially for a small L&D team.",

It is relatively simple to mirror you author structure and start creating content. I am the chief admin and use it daily to support, maintain and develop content. I have to day converted approx 1500 powerpoint slides into interactive, attractive content and this tool approx  4 months, so it was really easy to implement. Many thanks to my business success manager!  It is an elegant solution for a particular set of problems. The customer support is world class. There is chat option where the response is really fast by live agents, approx. within the hour by my experience. The support tool also gives you access to a comprehensive wiki and a lot of issues can be resolved this way. Most cases of requiring support were localised server or browser issues. The platform has maintained 100% uptime in the 2 or so years we have used it for our company. There is a transparent roadmap and a lovely surprise when they happen as they have ALWAYS been for the betterment for product and user experience. Many thanks for the testing/dev department and their communication. I believe these update comms can be turned off too from your profile. We have not required an special integration however I want to report deep integration exists between branded LXP's and the authoring tool. Although we did not require this, we still use the \"dynamic updates\" feature of SCORM publishing which is a game changer.",
        "dislikes": "It is designed it for a specific purpose so lacks the complexity of other authoring tools by design. Some more customisation would also be handy for certain situations although this may not be beneficial for less technically sound authors.",
